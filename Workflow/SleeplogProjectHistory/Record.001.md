# Sleeplog project history, record 001
formed on (19.10.2022)

### The idea of the app for the moment
Some people need to know when they sleep and how much time do they sleep.
Also sometimes it is important to understand the quality of sleep.

Sleeplog is an App that allows you to measure, record and view your sleep parameters.
Sleep is a very important part of our life. The quality of your life is directly related to the quality of your sleep.
If you need to influence your sleep, the first thing to do is to see what it is like. That's what Sleeplog is for.

Sleeplog helps you to live a healthy happy life.
