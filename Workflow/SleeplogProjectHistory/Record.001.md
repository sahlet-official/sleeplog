# Sleeplog project history, record 001
formed on (19.10.2022)

### The idea of the app for the moment
Some people need to know when they sleep and how much time do they sleep.
Also sometimes it is important to understand the quality of sleep.

Sleeplog is an App that allows you to measure, record and view your sleep parameters.
Sleep is a very important part of our life. The quality of your life is directly related to the quality of your sleep.
If you need to influence your sleep, the first thing to do is to see what it is like. That's what Sleeplog is for.

Sleeplog helps you to live a healthy happy life.

## Current project state

For the moment team is dealing with:
- [Buttonlog full version](https://github.com/sahlet-official/buttonlog/milestone/1)
- [0. Preparations](https://github.com/sahlet-official/sleeplog/milestone/4)

the Buttonlog app is the first iteration of Sleeplog app development.
The team of authors of the program consists mainly of students.
So it was decided to split the development process into iterations and execute the implementation step by step.
With this approach, it is much easier for a team of young professionals firstly to design, implement,
and produce a small and simple app to master the best practices for conducting a workflow, and then go further.
