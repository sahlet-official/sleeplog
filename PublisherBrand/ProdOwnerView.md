## Small logo
"FT" letters in black circle or square with rounded or simple (not rounded) corners.<br>
The shape of the background - needs to be seen to view and make a choice.<br>
"F" white, "T" red.<br>
The font of F is simple font.<br>
The font of T should look like careless brush strokes.<br>
The lines that form the letters are obtained with tears and irregularities.<br>
the letter T should look cool and sassy.<br>

## Logo in short intro video
#### The first part:
for some time period it is fool text "Freedom Toys" as on rectangular banner.<br>
The text ontop of big black background.<br>
<br>
#### The second part:
The small letters move behind the capital letters and disappear,<br>
and the capital letters move in as the small letters disappear.<br>
The camera zooms in as the text lines get smaller.<br>
in the last frame of this part, there are two capital letters "FT".<br>
<br>
#### The third part:
The camera keeps zooming in without stopping between the second and the third.<br>
Camera focus on the gap between the brush strokes in the letter "T".<br>
Over time, the camera zooms in so close that the outline of the letter "T"<br>
disappears from the screen and a dark screen remains.<br>
It also makes it possible for something else to be inserted<br>
inside this gap between the brush strokes of the letter "T".<br>
<br>
The idea like in [Netflix intro](https://youtu.be/GV3HUDMQ-F8).<br>
