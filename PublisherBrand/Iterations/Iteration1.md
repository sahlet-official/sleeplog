This is first iteration of creating logo for Freedom Toys made by designer according to [Product Owner view](https://github.com/sahlet-official/sleeplog/blob/develop/PublisherBrand/ProdOwnerView.md)<br>
<empty line>
Design was made acording to next lsit of requirements:
- Product Owner wishes the logo to contain red elements;<br>
- font of the logo must be simple;<br>
- the logo must have a symbolic meaning.<br>

Several design variations were made. I devided them to 3 groups:
- designs which were proposed by me;<br>
- designs which were proposed by Product Owner;<br>
- experimental designs.<br>
 
Design was made using Figma and can be seen [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ciA7yOiSqzYXabkYPZtjjy/FreedomToys?node-id=1%3A16&t=oA6l1WjzrlSPPJYq-1)
