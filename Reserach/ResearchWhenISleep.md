# Research on the topic: "How can I find out when I sleep with the help of a gadget?"

There is a need to know when the person sleeps.
There is an idea to estimate the moment of the start of sleep - monitor some user actions on a smartphone.

Before creating an application, it is worth understanding whether there are analogs on the market right now
and what functionality they offer.
It is also interesting to see if there are alternative options for meeting this need.

### Solving the issue of sleep from other industries
The railway industry offers an interesting way. The driver of the locomotive, on the night shift, must press the button from time to time to notify the system that he is awake. You can transfer this method to the user. If a person does not turn on the phone for a certain period of time, then the last pressing of the power button will be considered the moment of falling asleep. The disadvantage of this method is inaccuracy. A person can simply not touch the phone for a long time. But, if you connect a microphone, and to check a video camera, then the button method becomes much more accurate.

From a medical point of view, it is possible to conduct an EEG of the brain and take other physical parameters in order to accurately determine not only the moment of falling asleep, but also the sleep phases. But this method is very complicated, and smartphones have not yet reached the level of direct reading of the physiological parameters of the user's brain. There is an option using fitness trackers to determine whether a person is sleeping or not by pulse, but this is just as difficult to implement.

An application that allows you to read the log of your phone: [**SysLog**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tortel.syslog). But, this method is complicated due to the non-intuitive interface, and the large number of actions that the user must perform.
