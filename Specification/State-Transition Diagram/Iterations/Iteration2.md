After review of iteration 1 the next changes were made:
- list of use cases and application features revised. We decided not to change it until UX changes and State-Transition diagram iteration 3 weren`t made;
- Product Owner and designer conducted several UX/UI changes;
- Product Owner asked to merge State end Transition diagrams into one State-Transition diagram;
